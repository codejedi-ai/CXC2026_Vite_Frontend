# 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

UW-Crushes is built on a high-performance, modular architecture designed for real-time, low-latency voice interaction. We leverage the **LiveKit** ecosystem to handle the complexities of WebRTC, allowing us to focus on the agentic behavior and personality logic.

## 🧠 AI & Backend

### Core Frameworks
*   **[LiveKit Agents](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/):** The backbone of our real-time interaction. Handles the worker processes, room connection, and pipeline orchestration (VAD -> STT -> LLM -> TTS).
*   **Python 3.11+:** The primary language for all agent logic, chosen for its rich ecosystem of AI/ML libraries.
*   **LangGraph & Autogen:** (Conceptual/Experimental) Used to structure complex, multi-turn stateful conversations and manage the "memories" of the agents.

### Models & Intelligence
*   **LLM (Large Language Model):**
    *   **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash:** selected for its sub-second latency and massive context window, crucial for maintaining the "fast-paced" dialogue style of Waterloo students.
    *   **Inflection AI (Pi-3.1):** deeply integrated for "Vibe Check" analysis and emotional intelligence tasks.
    *   **Fallback Support:** Architecture also supports OpenAI (GPT-4o) and Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) via standard interfaces.
*   **TTS (Text-to-Speech):**
    *   **Rime.ai (Arcana):** The primary voice engine, chosen for its ability to generate extremely expressive, non-robotic speech with fillers like "um," "like," and laughter.
    *   **ElevenLabs:** Used for specific character archetypes ensuring distinct voice identities.
*   **STT (Speech-to-Text):**
    *   **OpenAI Whisper:** deeply integrated for accurate transcription of student slang and technical jargon.
*   **VAD (Voice Activity Detection):**
    *   **Silero VAD:** On-device voice detection to allow for natural interruptions and turn-taking without awkward pauses.

## 🖥️ Frontend (Web App)

*   **Next.js 14:** The React framework used for the main dashboard and "Match" interface.
*   **LiveKit Components:** Pre-built React hooks and components (`@livekit/components-react`) for visualizing audio waves and connection status.
*   **Recharts:** Used to render real-time graphs of "Social Elo" and "Cringe Velocity."
*   **TailwindCSS:** For rapid, responsive styling that matches the "Dating App" aesthetic.

## ☁️ Infrastructure & DevOps

*   **LiveKit Cloud:** Managed WebRTC infrastructure to ensure low-latency global connections.
*   **FastAPI / Uvicorn:** Serves the frontend tokens and handles authentication and webhook events.
*   **Docker:** Containerization for consistent deployment across dev and prod environments.
*   **Environment Management:** `python-dotenv` for secure handling of API keys (OpenAI, Rime, LiveKit, etc.).
